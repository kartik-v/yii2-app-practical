Contributing to yii2-app-practical
==================================
Looking to contribute something to yii2-app-practical? **Here's how you can help.**

We really appreciate clear bug reports that _consistently_ show an issue
_within yii2-app-practical_.

The ideal bug report follows these guidelines:

1. **Use the [GitHub issue search][issue-search]**  &mdash; Check if the issue
   has already been reported.
2. **Check if the issue has been fixed**  &mdash; Try to reproduce the problem
   using the code in the `master` branch.

Please try to be as detailed as possible in your bug report, especially if an
isolated test case cannot be made. Some useful questions to include the answer
to are:

- What steps can be used to reproduce the issue?
- What is the bug and what is the expected outcome?
- What browser(s) and Operating System have you tested with?
- Does the bug happen consistently across all tested browsers?
- What version of jQuery are you using? And what version of yii2-app-practical?
- Are you using yii2-app-practical with other plugins?

All of these questions will help others fix and identify any potential bugs.
