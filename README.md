Yii 2 Practical Project Template is a skeleton Yii 2 application based on the 
[yii2-advanced template](https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2-app-advanced/) best for 
developing complex Web applications with multiple tiers. The template allows a 
**practical** method to directly access the frontend from the app root.

The template includes three tiers: front end, back end, and console, each of which
is a separate Yii application.

The template is designed to work in a team development environment. It supports
deploying the application in different environments.

Why yii2-practical?
-------------------

After installing an `app` in the yii2-advanced application you normally would access the
frontend by:

```
http://domain/app/frontend/web
```

However, in many **practical** scenarios (especially on shared and single domain hosts) one 
would want their users to directly access frontend as:

```
http://domain/app
```

The `yii2-app-practical` enables you to achieve just that by carefully moving and rearranging the 
bootstrap files and web components of frontend to work directly out of the app root. The 
`frontend/web` is entirely eliminated and one can directly access the application frontend
this way:

```
http://domain/app
```

All other aspects of the app configuration remain the same as the **yii2-advanced** app. The `common`, `backend` and `console` 
will remain as is. The frontend config, assets, models, controllers, views, widgets and components, will still reside within 
the `frontend` directory. It is just the web access that is moved out to app root.

SOME KEY ADDITIONS
-------------------

1. The template has some security preconfigured for users with Apache web servers. It has a default `.htaccess` security configuration setup.
2. The template has prettyUrl enabled by default and the changes have been made to `.htaccess` as well as `urlManager`
   component config in the common config directory.
3. The template has isolated cookie settings for backend and frontend so that you can seamlessly access frontend and backend from same client. 
   The config files includes special `identity` and `csrf` cookie parameter settings for backend. Edit it according to your needs if necessary.

Detailed documentation can be referred at [docs/guide/README.md](docs/guide/README.md).
